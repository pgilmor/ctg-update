    "text": "Urges: (1) the President and the international community to join in supporting bilateral talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, and (2) the President to adopt a policy of opposing and vetoing if necessary one-sided Security Council resolutions targeting Israel.\n\nExpresses support for individuals and organizations working to bring about peace and cooperation between the Israelis and Palestinians. Calls on all parties to return to negotiations without preconditions.\n\nOpposes the use of the United Nations to impose external remedies to challenges between the Israelis and Palestinians. Objects to the December 2016 abstention and declination by the United States to veto U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334. (Such resolution characterizes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as illegal and demands cessation of settlement activities.)\n\nDeclares that the Senate regrets and seeks to reverse the negative public criticism of Israel by U.S. diplomats.\n\nRejects international efforts to delegitimize Israel's right to exist. Expresses support for Israel's right to self-defense. Condemns acts of terrorism and violence targeted at Israeli civilians. Reiterates that Palestinian political goals will never be achieved through violence."
