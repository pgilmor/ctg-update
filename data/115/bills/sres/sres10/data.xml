  <summary date="2017-01-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that:

 the use of illicit fentanyl in the United States and the resulting overdose deaths are a public health crisis; the trafficking of illicit fentanyl into the United States, especially by transnational criminal organizations, is a problem that requires close cooperation between the U.S. government and the governments of Mexico and China; and all three such countries have a shared interest in, and responsibility for, stopping the production of illicit fentanyl and its trafficking into the United States. Calls for the United States to:

 support the efforts by the governments of Mexico and China to stop such production and trafficking into the United States; take further measures to reduce and prevent heroin and fentanyl consumption through enhanced enforcement to reduce the illegal supply and increased use of evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery services; and use its broad diplomatic and law enforcement resources, in partnership with the governments of China and Mexico, to stop such production and trafficking.</summary>
