Calls for the United States to:\n\n support the efforts by the governments of Mexico and China to stop such production and trafficking into the United States; take further measures to reduce and prevent heroin and fentanyl consumption through enhanced enforcement to reduce the illegal supply and increased use of evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery services; and use its broad diplomatic and law enforcement resources, in partnership with the governments of China and Mexico, to stop such production and trafficking."
