  <summary date="2017-03-02T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Condemns continued Russian military intervention in Ukraine.

Calls on: (1) the government of the Russian Federation to immediately cease all activity that seeks to normalize or recognize the Russian-backed rebel separatists in Eastern Ukraine; and (2) the U.S. government, U.S. allies in Europe, the United Nations, and international partners to continue to pressure the government of the Russian Federation to uphold its international obligations.

Affirms that sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation for destabilizing the international order in Eastern Europe should not be lifted until it complies with all terms of the Minsk agreements and ceases its illegal attempts to annex Ukraine's Crimea.</summary>
