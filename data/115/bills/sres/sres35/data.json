The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCalls on the government of Venezuela to:\n\n release all political prisoners and to respect internationally recognized human rights; ensure the neutrality and professionalism of all security forces and to respect the Venezuelan people's rights to freedom of expression and assembly; and halt its efforts to undermine the principle of separation of powers, its circumvention of the democratically elected legislature, and its subjugation of judicial independence. Expresses support for: (1) meaningful efforts toward a dialogue that leads to respect for Venezuela's constitutional mechanisms and resolves the country's political, economic, social, and humanitarian crisis; and (2) Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General Almagro's invocation of Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Urges the OAS Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the constitutional and democratic order in Venezuela.\n\nStresses the urgency of strengthening the rule of law and increasing efforts to combat impunity and public corruption in Venezuela.\n\nUrges the President of the United States to provide full support for OAS efforts in favor of constitutional and democratic solutions to the political impasse and to instruct federal agencies to hold officials of the Venezuelan government accountable for violations of U.S. law and abuses of internationally recognized human rights."
